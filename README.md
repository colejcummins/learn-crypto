# Learn Crypto

Learn Crypto is a suite of lesson plans and sample projects for teaching introductory crypto concepts to students

## Curriculum

All projects are done in python with example code and project specifications outlining what is expected 

### 1. Python Introduction

Python/programming beginners start with the *Python Introduction*, using the *Python Toolkit* as a resource

This is a short introduction to python concepts, including: 

 * Basic function definitions
 
 * Default classes such as `string` and `list`
 
 * Basic control statements like the `for` and `while` loop
 
The *Python Introduction* suplements learning concepts with [Codingbat](https://codingbat.com/python) problems to reinforce concepts taught

The *Python Toolkit* highlights basic python functions and statements by providing example code, encouraging students to use the python shell in the terminal as a resource 

### 2. Sample Projects

The four projects outlined are as follows:

 * **Shift Cipher** as a basic substitution cipher that introduces user input, string and list operations, touching on ascii encoding

 * **Enigma Machine** is another substitution cipher that highlights mapping and dictionaries 

 * **Image Steganography** introduces bitwise operations, file IO, and different aspects of bitmap files

 * **SHA2 Hash** introduces hashing algorithms and reinforces bitwise operations

More projects will be added in the future!
